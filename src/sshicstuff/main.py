"""
Single Stranded DNA Hi-C pipeline for generating oligo 4-C profiles and aggregated contact matrices.

usage:
    sshicstuff [-hv] <command> [<args>...]

options:
    -h, --help                  shows the help
    -v, --version               shows the version

The subcommands are:
    gui                 Open a graphical user interface for the pipeline to visualize profiles.

    subsample           Subsample and compress FASTQ file using seqtk.

    genomaker           Create a chromosome artificial that is the concatenation of the
                        annealing oligos and the enzyme sequence.

    associate           Associate oligo/probe name to fragment/read ID that contains it.

    hiconly             Keep only Hi-C reads from a sparse matrix file (i.e., remove all ssDNA reads).

    filter              Filter reads from a sparse matrix and keep only pairs of reads that contain at least one
                        oligo/probe.

    coverage            Calculate the coverage per fragment and save the result to a bedgraph.

    profile             Generate a 4C-like profile for each ssDNA oligo.

    rebin               Rebin change binning resolution of a 4C-like profile

    stats               Generate statistics and normalization for contacts made by each probe.

    aggregate           Aggregate all 4C-like profiles on centromeric or telomeric regions.
